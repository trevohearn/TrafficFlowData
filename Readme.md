# Traffic Flow of Syndey, Australia
- This project aims to predict traffic patterns on the Eastern Distributor Highway (M1) in Sydney, Australia. The data was provided by the government of New South Wales for the Williams Street Exit toll (https://nswtollroaddata.com). With this information, city planners, trucking companies, and commuters can better plan and predict future traffic levels and plan their commutes accordingly.

# Process
- Standardize the Model
- Create features to aid in the time series analysis process
- Test AR, ARIMA, SARIMAX models using different parameters
- Use Grid Search Cross Validation to determine the best parameters

## Autocorrelation of Total Volume of Traffic

## Partial Autocorrelation of Total Volume of Traffic
![partial_autocorr_weekdiff](https://github.com/trevohearn/TrafficFlowData/blob/master/images/partial_autocorr_weekdiff.png)
- This partial autocorrelation uses a feature that is offset by a week

# Time Savings
- No traffic : **8 - 12** min.
- Medium traffic : **9 - 16** min.
- Full traffic : **14 - 26** min.
